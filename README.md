Nurturing Essential Soft Skills in Kids Through Safe and Engaging Generative AI

This Project is developed as part of informative Code Vipassana sessions

Generative AI for Kids' Soft Skills Development
Welcome to the repository for using Generative AI to enhance soft skills in children! This project leverages Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and various AI tools to create an interactive, safe, and educational experience for kids.

What We're Trying to Achieve
In today's world, teaching kids essential soft skills like communication, critical thinking, and creativity can be challenging. Our goal is to use Generative AI to create a dynamic learning environment where kids can practice these skills in a fun and engaging way. By integrating AI models with GCP, we aim to provide:

Interactive Learning: Realistic scenarios that help kids develop soft skills.
Safe Space: AI with built-in safety features to ensure a responsible learning experience.
Adaptive Feedback: Real-time responses that guide and encourage kids.
